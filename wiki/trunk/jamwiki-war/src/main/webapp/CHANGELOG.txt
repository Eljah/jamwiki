  * Trim leading and trailing whitespace during parsing when a template is
    included to fix breakage of wiki table syntax such as "!{{Hl2}}| Word".

  * Links containing templates or magic words of the form "[[{{PAGENAME}}]]"
    should properly resolve the template/magic word.
  * If a namespace is not case-sensitive (user, template, category) then the
    associated comments namespace should not be case-sensitive either.
  * Interwiki links should not be rel="nofollow".

    "[[Topic|caption with http://example.com link]]".
  * Wiki pre syntax (" pre <span>HTML</span>") should allow HTML, although
    HTML pre ("<pre>pre <span>HTML</span></pre>") should not.
  * Fix an issue that caused the original image URL (instead of the resized
    image URL) to be used for syntax such as "[[Image:Example.jpg|200px]]".

  * Fix issues where image transparency was lost after resizing.
  * Fix issue that prevented use of wiki headings within tables.
  * The Bliki parser was not included in the distribution and thus could not
