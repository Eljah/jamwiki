-- Oracle README for Very Quick Wiki V2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


You need the classes12.zip Oracle JDBC Thin driver. Either include it
in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the VQWiki webapp, or in a
container-specific lib directory that is made available to your
container's webapps. For Tomcat, that is tomcat/shared/lib. In the
case of Tomcat, rename the file to classes12.jar. The Tomcat classpath
builder doesn't see zip files as libraries.

This code should also work with the OCI driver. However, you're on
your own as to configuring the native code library so that the OCI
JDBC driver can see it.

The classes12.zip can be downloaded from:

http://otn.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html


In the VQWiki Administration Servlet, specify the following:

JDBC driver class: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
Database type    : oracle
Database URL     : jdbc:oracle:thin:@dbserver:port:dbname
Database Username: as appropriate
Database Password: as appropriate
Validation query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DUAL

Fill in the values for dbserver, port and dbname in as appropriate for
your environment. Ask your database administrator.


VQWiki will automatically create the tables if it has the privileges
to do so. If not, ask your database administrator to execute the
create_oracle.sql script as the schema owner.

VQWiki will try to recreate the tables every time it starts up. This
will cause errors such as: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00955: name is
already used by an existing object. These can be safely ignored.


If you get "Table or view does not exist", even though the tables do exist:

The database user must be able to see the tables without prefixing a
schema name. You may need to create public synonyms for the tables if
the schema owner is not the database user. Again, ask your database
administrator to create public synonyms for the VQWiki tables if this
is the case.

If VQWiki doesn't create the tables:

Check the log files. If there are messages about SQL syntax errors,
check the vqwiki.properties file in WEB-INF/classes and the
administration servlet to make sure the database-type is set to
"oracle".
