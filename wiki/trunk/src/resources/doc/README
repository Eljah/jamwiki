--- README for Java MediaWiki v2.7.8 ---

If you don't know how to use a WikiWikiWeb, visit the original at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki and have a read.

Please read the "UPGRADE" file for upgrading information if you are upgrading your existing JMWiki installation.

You'll find the new JMWiki book in the doc directory of the WAR file which is therefore accessible from
the wiki context root, (e.g. http://localhost:8080/jmwiki-2.7.8/doc/jmwiki_book.html) and on the website:
http://www.jmwiki.org/docs/jmwiki_book.html

The DocBook version of the file is also supplied in the "doc" directory of the WAR file and is called jmwiki_book.xml

Installation instructions are in the "INSTALL" file - more detailed ones are in the new JMWiki book.

App servers that users have said jmwiki works with:
Tomcat 4.1.x
Tomcat 5.x
Orion 1.6
JBoss/Jetty
JBoss/Tomcat 4.x
Resin 2.1.7
Allaire JRun 4.x
BEA WebLogic 7.x
IBM Websphere 5
Oracle 9i Application Server

Java MediaWiki requires JavaServlets 2.3 compatibility. It will not work properly with non-2.3 compatible
containers, e.g. Tomcat 3.x, Orion 1.5.
