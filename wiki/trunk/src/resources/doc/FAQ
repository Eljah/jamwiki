---FAQ for the JAMWiki last updated 30 September 2002---

---General Questions---

*How do I install JAMWiki?

Follow your application server instructions for deploying a WAR. Usually it's just a matter
of plonking the WAR file into the webapps directory.

*How do I access the admin console (aka how do I turn on/turn off this that or the other)?

The URL for the admin console is your wiki's deployment URL, the jsp context and then
admin.jsp. E.g. http://localhost:8080/wiki/jsp/admin.jsp.
You must have a user with the role "admin" setup to access the console. Follow your application
server instructions for setting up users and roles (realms).

*Why do I get a "method/symbol not found" error for getRequestURL()

JAMWiki uses the Servlets 2.3 API as release in 2000 and available with Tomcat 4.x, J2EE 1.3,
JRun 4 etc. Servlets 2.2 won't work well with JAMWiki.

---Config Questions---

*Why is my Windows file upload path appending two paths together?

Make sure you use "/" forward slashes as the file separator in the option setting - not
back-slashes "\".

---Markup Questions---

*Why doesn't "THIsIsALink" automagically link correctly?

Vqwiki uses the original Wiki regular expressions for the processing of "CamelCaps". More
than one consecutive uppercase letter violates that regular expression. If you want to link
words of the form above, turn the back-tick linking on in the admin console and use
back-ticks to do your linking.

---Resin Questions---

*Why are my links not working properly under Apache/Resin?

Thanks to Rod Morimoto:

IE would handle the jamwiki pages fine but netscape wouldn't and instead
just show the html source.
We modified DefaultType on httpd.conf from text/plain to text/html.
Apparently Netscape interprets text/plain as simply that, while
IE tries to be more helpful (!).
Caucho says "the difference between Resin standalone and Apache/Resin
is that Apache is trying to be clever.  If it doesn't see any content
type it sets text/plain.  Resin standalone isn't setting the
Content-Type at all and your browser is just guessing that the actual content is
text/html"  (the latter in the case of IE only).


---Tomcat Questions---

---JBoss Questions---

*How do I configure the security context on JBoss to get at my admin console?

Thanks to Dan Meany:

This goes in jboss-web.xml:
<jboss-web>
	<security-domain>java:/jaas/other</security-domain>
</jboss-web>

all the user needs to do is add a users.properties and roles.properties in the conf directory
(may need to contain a trailing '#' comment due to a bug where the last char gets cut off).
this goes in "users.properties":
#users.properties
dan=pwd
#

this goes in "roles.properties":
#roles.properties
dan=admin
#
