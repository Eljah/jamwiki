---MySQL README for Java MediaWiki V2.1---

You must have the MySQL JDBC driver installed in the lib directory of your web container,
or in the lib directory for the JMWiki webapp. On Tomcat, this would be 
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/jmwiki-2.1/lib
You can download the jmwiki distrbution with the MySQL driver already installed, or you
can download the latest driver from:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15923

Java MediaWiki will setup its own tables on startup, provided that the connection settings
are correct, but before running it, you need to create the MySQL database and grant the 
appropriate access rights to the jmwiki user.

The default settings are for a database called "jmwiki" with a user called "jmwiki" with
password "jmwiki". If you were to use those settings, and the MySQL server is running on
the same machine as the web container, the following two statements will prepare the database:

create database jmwiki;
grant all on jmwiki.* to jmwiki@localhost identified by 'jmwiki';

The easiest way to do this is to find your MySQL binary - on Windows this is called "mysql.exe"
and is in your <mysql-home>\bin directory. On Linux it's just called "mysql" and is usually in
/usr/bin. If you run the mysql binary, you'll be presented with the mysql prompt, at which you
can just copy and paste in the statements above.

Obviously, you may need to change the hostname from localhost if you are connecting from a
different machine to the one running the database, or if you have set MySQL to bind to an address
other than the localhost loopback, e.g. if MySQL is bound to a network card.

To enable the database support, go to the admin console: 
<myurl>/jsp/admin.jsp
...and change the persistence type to DATABASE. Click "Save Changes", this will produce a new
group of settings for URL, database driver, username and password.
