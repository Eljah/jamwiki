---README for JAMWiki PostgreSQL support---

Not really a lot to do here. Set up a Postgres database and grant priveleges to someone
sensible.

Head to http://jdbc.postgresql.org and download the latest JDBC 3 driver. Put the drive jar
in {wikiinstall}/WEB-INF/lib.

Use the admin console and change the persistence type to "database" and the database type
to "postgres". Fill in the rest of the database options and save the settings.
