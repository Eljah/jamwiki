--- INSTALLATION for JAMWiki v2.7.8 ---

** NOTE THAT VQWIKI *DOES NOT* REQUIRE AN EXTERNAL DATABASE - DATABASE SUPPORT IS OPTIONAL **

If you are upgrading from an ealier verions of jamwiki, please read the UPGRADE file.

JAMWiki is tested with Tomcat 4.1.24 (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat) and Sun JDK 1.4.2
Users have also reported that works with the following:
Tomcat 4.1.x
Orion 1.6
JBoss/Jetty
JBoss/Tomcat 4.x
Resin 2.1.7
Allaire JRun 4.x
BEA WebLogic 7.x
IBM Websphere 5
Oracle 9i Application Server

Theoretically it should work with any J2EE web container that support Servlets 2.3 (i.e.
*not* Tomcat 3.x)

If you do get it working with another container, please let us know: support@jamwiki.org

-- Steps --
1. Deploy JAMWiki as you would any WAR file, in the case of Tomcat just put it in
   the webapps directory and start Tomcat up.

2. With a WAR name of "jamwiki-2.7.8.war", the default local URL for Tomcat will
   be http://localhost:8080/jamwiki-2.7.8

If you are upgrading... remember to delete the old caches of the application. In Tomcat,
delete the $TOMCAT_HOME/work directory. This will ensure there are no problems with cached
files being loaded.
