Emphasis:
Two single quotes __''around text''__ for ''italics''
Three single quotes __'''around text'''__ for '''bold'''
Five __'''''around text'''''__ for '''''bold italic''''', i.e. 3 + 2
Lists: {3 spaces}* for bullet lists, {3 spaces}# for numbered lists, e.g.
Bulleted
	*item one
	*item two
The three spaces will be converted into tab characters when the page is saved.
Sub-lists can be created by using multiple sets of three spaces, e.g. 6 spaces for level two of the list etc.
References: Also known as WikiName''''''s. JoinCapitalizedWords to refer to a topic or create a reference to a new topic. Note that the regular expression for JoinCapitalizedWords is very strict, two upper-case letters in a row break the reference.

There is an escape sequence to allow topics which are not joined capitalized words, the sequence is backtick-text-backtick, e.g. __`ACM`__. This is a user-requested feature and an extension beyond the normal rules. It is ideal where you wish to refer to an acronym.
External References:
	*A reference to a topic on the c2.com Wiki can be created with the form __c2:TopicName__
	*A reference to Meatball Wiki can be created with __mb:TopicName__ E.g. c2:StartingPoints
	*A reference to the Microsoft Knowledge Base can be made with __mskb:QXXXXXX__ where the QXXXXXX is the article number
URLs: Images referred to by URL will appear in-line, other URLs will appear as hyperlinks, just use the usual syntax, i.e. http://www.jmwiki.org/wiki/
Formatting __between double underscores__ is ignored, unless the double underscore is preceded by a backslash: \
__You can use tables by putting four hashes (####) on a line by themselves, then one table row of text per line with two hashes (##) after each cell (including the last cell in the row. End the table with four hashes by themselves.__
Pre-formatted text can be displayed by leading with four at signs (@@@@) by themselves. Leave a blank line by itself to end the block, e.g.:
@@@@
here is some preformatted code

Inline code can be produced by surrounding text in three braces: __{{{code}}}__ = {{{code}}}

To set an automatic redirection from one topic to another, just put redirect:OtherTopicName as the body of the topic. If you wish to change or remove the redirection later, put text of the form edit:TopicName in some other topic - this will link directly to the edit page for the given topic so the redirection can be altered or removed.
