INTRODUCTION
============

This document provides information for upgrading JAMWiki.  In most cases the
JAMWiki upgrade process can be completed automatically by following the steps
below, but in the case of errors manual upgrade steps may need to be followed.


AUTOMATIC UPGRADES
==================

In most cases the JAMWiki process can be handled automatically by following
these steps:

  1. Download the latest JAMWiki WAR file.
  2. Back up all database and/or file data prior to upgrading.
  3. Back up the jamwiki.properties file and the logging.properties file that
     can be found in the /WEB-INF/classes directory.
  4. If you have created any virtual wikis, back up the web.xml file that can
     be found in the /WEB-INF directory.
  5. Remove the old JAMWiki installation.
  6. Install the new JAMWiki WAR file.  See your web application server's
     documentation for instructions.
  7. Copy the files backed up in steps three and four back into their old
     locations, overwriting any new files.  Be sure that permissions are set
     so that JAMWiki has read and write access to all files in the
     installation.
  8. View any page on the Wiki.  You will be redirected to the upgrade page
     and any required upgrade steps will be automatically performed.


MANUAL UPGRADES
===============

Manual upgrades should only be followed if an error occurs while upgrading
JAMWiki automatically.  When upgrading manually, you must perform all upgrade
steps sequentially for each version that is being upgraded.  For example, if
upgrading from version 0.3.0 to version 0.3.3, you must apply the upgrade
steps for 0.3.1, followed by 0.3.2, followed by 0.3.3.


  JAMWiki 0.3.4
  =============

  1. Update the /WEB-INF/classes/jamwiki.properties file by changing the
     "wiki-version" property to "0.3.4".
  2. Update the /WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties file with appropriate
     values for your setup.  See the comments within that file for
     descriptions of what each value specifies.


  JAMWiki 0.3.3
  =============

  1. Update the /WEB-INF/classes/jamwiki.properties file by changing the
     "wiki-version" property to "0.3.3".


  JAMWiki 0.3.2
  =============

  1. Update the /WEB-INF/classes/jamwiki.properties file by changing the
     "wiki-version" property to "0.3.2".
