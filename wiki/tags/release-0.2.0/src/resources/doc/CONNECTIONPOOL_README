-- Connection pooling README for JAMWiki V2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database persistence uses the Apache Commons DBCP (Database Connection
Pooling) to provide robust database performance.

Nothing special needs to be configured to make this work, it's there out
of the box. The default configuration should suffice for most situations,
but all connection pool parameters are configurable from the administration
page.

These options should be self-explanatory. For more details on the inner
workings of DBCP, take a look at the DBCP and Pool homepages:

If you want to use a database type other than MySQL, you should pay close
attention to the "validation query" parameter. This is a small query to be
executed to test the validity of the connection. For MySQL, the query
"SELECT 1" is appropriate, which is the default. No table is specified,
because the fact that the query is received and processed by the server is
enough to ensure the connection is still alive and well. For other database
types, other queries are appropriate. For Oracle, "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
DUAL" is a useful validation query. The table "DUAL" is a special built-in
table with a single row for exactly this kind of purpose.

If you use another database type, consult your database's documentation for
details on what is a usable validation query for you.
