The term social anarchism is often used to identify [[communitarian]] forms of anarchism that emphasize cooperation and mutual aid. Social anarchism includes anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism, [[social ecology]] and sometimes mutualism.\n\n====Collectivist anarchism====\n{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}\n\'\'Collectivist anarchism\'\', also referred to as \'\'revolutionary socialism\'\' or a form of such<ref>Morris, Brian.

The collectivist \'\'category\'\' is also sometimes known as social, socialist, or communitarian anarchism category.</ref> Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "[[propaganda by the deed]]," which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.<ref name = "Patsouras-p54"/>  However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.

Sometimes, green anarchism is said to be techno-positive or techno-negative to differentiate between those who advocate use of advanced green technology to create and maintain an anarchist society and those who mainly see civilization and modern technology as something negative.\n\n[[Anarcho-primitivism]] is a form of green anarchism that believes [[agriculture]] and [[division of labour]] inevitably lead to inequality and are incompatible with anarchism and in effect must be abolished. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize traditional anarchism for supporting [[civilization]] and modern [[technology]] which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation.  They instead advocate the process of [[rewilding]] or reconnecting with the natural environment.\n\nNon-primitivist green anarchists, such as anthropologist [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]], often draw influence from the [[social ecology]] of [[Murray Bookchin]].\n\n== As a social movement==\nAnarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].<ref>Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, "Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters", in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), \'\'Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age\'\' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p.3.</ref>\n===The First International===\n[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|right|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the anti-authoritarians in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.<ref name=bbc/>]]\n\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], wherein ten countries experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist revolutions.  After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.<ref>{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789 - 1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

Due to its links to active workers\' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon\'s followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx\'s [[state socialism]], advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0595249124 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=187}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his associates joined the First International � which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the anti-authoritarian socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarized into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.<ref>{{cite book | last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0810117401 |page=140}}</ref> Bakunin characterised Marx\'s ideas as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.<ref name="bakuninmarx"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|id=ISBN 0�521�36973�8}}</ref> In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.

The men became international political celebrities among the labor movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labor movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organize for the eight hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.<ref>{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 }}</ref> The celebration of [[International Workers\' Day]] on [[May Day]] became an annual event the following year.\n\nIn 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Beno�t Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], [[Christiaan Cornelissen]], etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social [[revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.<ref>[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta\'s declaration] {{fr icon}}</ref> Malatesta thought that trade-unions were [[reformism|reformist]], and could even be, at times, [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example [[Labor unions in the United States|US trade-unions]], where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.\n\nThe Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederaci�n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederaci�n General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederaci�n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.<ref>Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993�2003" (International:SPIRE Associates 2004)</ref> Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.\n\n=== Russian Revolution===\n{{main|Russian Revolution (1917)}}\n[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Ukraine]], anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin\'s]] predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist� Marxist state would become a new elite<ref name="bakuninmarx">"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen\'s Association and Karl Marx]" in \'\'Bakunin on Anarchy\'\', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971</ref> had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Conf�d�ration g�n�rale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the \'\'[[Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]\'\',<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda group |authorlink=Dielo Trouda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkism.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}</ref> was supported. [[Platformist]] groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.\n\n[[Image:Members of the Maquis in La Tresorerie.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-fascist [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], who resisted [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] rule in Europe.]]\n\n===Fight against fascism===\n{{main|Anti-fascism}}{{See also|Anarchism in Italy|Anarchism in France|Anarchism in Spain}}\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism\'s conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation \'\'[[Arditi del Popolo]]\'\', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.<ref>Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 "Daring but Divided"] (\'\'Socialist Review\'\' November 2002)</ref> In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.<ref>Berry, David. "Fascism or Revolution." \'\'Le Libertaire\'\'. August 1936)</ref>\n\nIn Spain, the [[Confederaci�n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936�1939). In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivized]] the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. According to [[George Orwell]] and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[Workers\' Party of Marxist Unification|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.\n\n==Internal issues and debates==\n{{main|Issues in anarchism}}\n<!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. -->\nAnarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]] (which anarchists usually reject, according to the \'\'[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]\'\'),<ref name=oxcom/> [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.\n\nPhenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.\n\nOn a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[Issues in anarchism#Definitional concerns|definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Anarchism portal}}\n* [[Anarchist symbolism]]\n* [[List of basic anarchism topics]]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{main|List of anarchist books}}\n* \'\'Anarchism.

According to The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, &quot;there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance.&quot;[2]\nThere are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.[3][4][5] Anarchism is usually considered to be a radical left-wing ideology,[6] and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism or participatory economics; however, anarchism has always included an economic and legal individualist strain,[7] with that strain supporting an anarchist free-market economy and private property (like classical mutualism or today anarcho-capitalism and agorism).[8][9][10][11] Others, such as panarchists and anarchists without adjectives, neither advocate nor object to any particular form of organization as long as it is not compulsory. Some anarchist schools of thought differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.[12] The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement is represented by communist anarchism, with anarcho-individualism being primarily a philosophical/literary phenomenon.[13] Some anarchists fundamentally oppose all forms of coercion, while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution and terrorism, on the path to anarchy.[14]\nThe term anarchism derives from the Greek ???????, anarchos, meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,[15][16] from the prefix ??- (an-, &quot;without&quot;) + ???? (arch&#65533;, &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)[17] + -????? (-ismos, from a stem -?????, -izein). There is some ambiguity with the use of the terms &quot;libertarianism&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; in writings about anarchism. Since the nineteenth century, the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1970s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the U.S.[18] Accordingly, libertarian socialism&quot; sometimes is used as a synonym for non-individualist anarchism,[19] that is, socialist anarchism,[20] to dilineate it from individualist libertarianism (individualist anarchism). On the other hand, some of those who do not use &quot;libertarianism&quot; as a synonym for anarchism but use it to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, sometimes refer to free-market anarchism as &quot;libertarian anarchism.&quot;[21][22]\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Origins\n2 Schools of thought\n2.1 Individualist anarchism\n2.1.1 William Godwin\n2.1.2 Egoism\n2.1.3 The American tradition\n\n2.2 Proudhon\'s Mutualism\n2.3 Social anarchism\n2.3.1 Collectivist anarchism\n2.3.2 Anarchist communism\n\n2.4 Anarchism without adjectives\n2.4.1 Anarcho-syndicalism\n\n2.5 Post-classical schools of thought\n2.5.1 Anarcho-capitalism\n2.5.2 Anarcha-feminism\n2.5.3 Green anarchism\n\n\n3 As a social movement\n3.1 The First International\n3.2 Organized labor\n3.3 Russian Revolution\n3.4 Fight against fascism\n\n4 Internal issues and debates\n5 Footnotes\n6 See also\n7 Further reading\n8 External links\n8.1 General resources\n8.2 Biographical and bibliographical\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigins\nTemplate:Main Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of Taoist sages Laozi[23] and Zhuangzi.

A great brigand becomes a ruler of a State.&quot;[24] Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics, and their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.[23][25]\nModern anarchism, however, sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau\'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.[26] Although by the turn of the 19th century the term &quot;anarchist&quot; had an entirely positive connotation,[27] it first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists to damn those who were fomenting disorder.[28] By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the Enrag�s, began to use the term positively,[29]Template:Verify credibility in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as oxymoronic.[30] From this climate William Godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought.[31] Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.&quot;[23]&quot;/&gt;[32]\nThe first to describe himself as an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon,[26] which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.[33] Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &#65533;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;[34] and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;[35] Like Godwin, Proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action. He saw anarchy as &quot;a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune.&quot;[36] By &quot;commune&quot;, Proudhon meant local self-government or according to literal translation, &quot;municipality&quot;, rather than a communist arrangement.[37]\n\nSchools of thought\nTemplate:Main\nImage:WilliamGodwin.jpg\nIndividualist anarchism\nTemplate:Main Individualist anarchism comprises several traditions[38] which hold that &quot;individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority.&quot;[39] Individualist anarchism is supportive of property being held privately, unlike the social/socialist/collectivist/communitarian wing which advocates common ownership.[40] Individualist anarchism has been espoused by individuals such as Max Stirner, William Godwin,[41] Henry David Thoreau,[42] Josiah Warren and Murray Rothbard.[43][44][45]\n\nWilliam Godwin\nIn 1793, Godwin who has often[46] been cited as the first anarchist, wrote Political Justice, which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.[47][31] Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.[48][31] Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.[49][50] Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us &quot;of more worth and importance\' than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person\'s life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good.[51] Godwin opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual\'s right to &quot;private judgement&quot; to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual\'s judgement. This aspect of Godwin\'s philosophy, stripped of utilitarian motivations, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.[52]\nImage:Max stirner.jpg\n\nEgoism\nTemplate:Details The most extreme[53] form of individualist anarchism, called &quot;egoism,&quot;[54] was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, Max Stirner,[55]  Stirner\'s The Ego and Its Own, published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.[55] According to Stirner\'s conception, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,[56] without regard for God, state, or moral rules.[57] To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;Template:Ndash he supported a concept of property held by force of might rather than moral right.[58] By &quot;property&quot; he is not referring only to things but to other people as well.[59] Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw &quot;associations of egoists&quot; where respect for ruthlessness drew people together.[60] Even murder is permissible &quot;if it is right for me.&quot;[61] Stirner saw the state as illegitimate but did not see individuals as having a duty to eliminate it nor does he recommend that they try to eliminate it; rather, he advocates that they disregard the state when it conflicts with their autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to their interests.[62] However, while he thought there was no duty to eliminate state, he does think it will eventually collapse as a result of the spread of egoism.[63]\nIn Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.[64] They rejected organizing, believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism.[65] This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcho-feminist Emma Goldman.[66] Though Stirner\'s egoism is individualist, it has also influenced some anarcho-communists.[67] Forms of libertarian communism such that developed by the Situationist International are strongly egoist in nature.[68]\nImage:LysanderSpooner.jpg\n\nThe American tradition\nTemplate:Further Another form of individualist anarchism was advocated by the &quot;Boston anarchists,&quot;[69] American individualists who supported private property exchangeable in a free market.[70] They advocated the protection of liberty and property by private contractors,[71] and endorsed exchange of labor for wages.[72] They did not have a problem that &quot;one man employ another&quot; or that &quot;he direct him,&quot; in his labor but demanded that &quot;all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished.&quot;[73] They believed state monopoly capitalism (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly)[74] prevented labor from being fully rewarded. Even among the nineteenth century American individualists, there was not a monolithic doctrine, as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including intellectual property rights and possession versus property in land.[75][76][77] A major cleft occurred later in the 19th century when Tucker and some others abandoned natural rights and converted to an &quot;egoism&quot; modeled upon Stirner\'s philosophy.[78] Some &quot;Boston anarchists&quot;, like Tucker, identified themselves as &quot;socialist&quot; &#65533; a term which at the time denoted a broad concept &#65533; by which he meant a commitment to solving &quot;the labor problem&quot; by radical economic reform.[79] By the turn of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed,[80] although it was later revived with modifications by Murray Rothbard and the anarcho-capitalists in the mid-twentieth century, as a current of the broader libertarian movement,[81][82] and the anti-capitalist strain by intellectuals such as Kevin Carson.\nImage:Proudhon.jpg\n\nProudhon\'s Mutualism\nTemplate:Main Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labor movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.[83] Proudhon\'s ideas were introduced by Charles A. Dana,[84] to individualist anarchists in the United States including Benjamin Tucker and William Batchelder Greene.[85]\nMutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to Greene, in the mutualist system each worker would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;[86] Mutualism has been retrospectively characterized as being ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.[87] Proudhon first characterized his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;[88]\n\nSocial anarchism\nTemplate:Main Social anarchism is one of two different broad categories of anarchism, the other category being individualist anarchism. The term social anarchism is often used to identify communitarian forms of anarchism that emphasize cooperation and mutual aid. Social anarchism includes anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism, social ecology and sometimes mutualism.\n\nCollectivist anarchism\nTemplate:Main Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such[89][90], is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most.[91] [92] It is a specific tendency, not to be confused with the broad category sometimes called collectivist or communitarian anarchism.[93] Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or &quot;propaganda by the deed,&quot; which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.[91]  However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by later anarcho-communists as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.[94] Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas were not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.[95] Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.[96]\nImage:Kropotkin Nadar.jpg\n\nAnarchist communism\nTemplate:Main Anarchist communists propose that the freest form of social organisation would be a society composed of self-governing communes with collective use of the means of production, organized by direct democracy, and related to other communes through federation.[97]\nHowever, some anarchist communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor consensus democracy.[98] In anarchist communism, as money would be abolished, individuals would not receive direct compensation for labour (through sharing of profits or payment) but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.[99] According to anarchist communist Peter Kropotkin and later Murray Bookchin, the members of such a society would spontaneously perform all necessary labour because they would recognize the benefits of communal enterprise and mutual aid.[100]Template:Page number Kropotkin believed that private property was one of the causes of oppression and exploitation and called for its abolition,[101][102] advocating instead common ownership.[103] Kropotkin said that &quot;houses, fields, and factories will no longer be private property, and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money, wages, and trade would be abolished.&quot;[104] In response to those criticizing Kropotkin for supporting expropriation of homes and means of production from those who did not wish to take part in anarcho-communism, he replied that if someone did not want to join the commune they would be left alone as long as they are a &quot;peasant who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate,&quot; or &quot;a family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space... considered necessary for that number of people&quot; or an artisan &quot;working with their own tools or handloom.&quot;[105] arguing that &quot;[t]he landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source.&quot;[105]\nThe status of anarchist communism within anarchism is disputed, because most individualist anarchists consider communitarianism incompatible with political freedom.[106] However Anarcho communism does not always have a communitarian philosophy, Some forms of anarchist communism are strongly Egoist,[107] and are strongly influenced by radical individualist philosophy, believing that anarcho-communism does not require a communitarian nature at all. Anarchist communist Emma Goldman blended the philosophies of both Max Stirner and Kropotkin in her own.[108]\nPlatformism is an anarchist communist tendency in the tradition of Nestor Makhno, who argued for the &quot;vital need of an organization which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement.&quot;[109]\n\nAnarchism without adjectives\nTemplate:Main &quot;Anarchism without adjectives&quot;, in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, &quot;referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others,&#65533;[it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools.&quot;[110] &quot;Anarchism without adjectives&quot; emphasizes harmony among various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs. The position was first adopted in 1889 by Fernando Tarrida del M�rmol as a call for toleration, after being troubled by the &quot;bitter debates&quot; among the different anarchist movements.[111] Voltairine de Cleyre,[112] Errico Malatesta,[113] and Fred Woodworth are noteworthy exponents of the view.[114]\n\nAnarcho-syndicalism\nTemplate:Main Image:Anarchist flag.svg In the early 20th century, anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism.[115]  With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by the workers.\nAnarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles include workers\' solidarity, direct action (such as general strikes and workplace recuperations), and workers\' self-management. This is compatible with other branches of anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to anarchist communist or collectivist anarchist economic systems.[116]  Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution.\nAn early leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker was Rudolf Rocker, whose 1938 pamphlet Anarchosyndicalism outlined a view of the movement\'s origin, aims and importance to the future of labour.[116][117]\nAlthough more often associated with labor struggles of the early 20th century (particularly in France and Spain), many syndicalist organizations are active today, united across national borders by membership in the International Workers Association, including the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden (SAC) in Sweden, the Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI) in Italy, the CNT in Spain, and the Industrial Workers of the World in the United States.\n\nPost-classical schools of thought\nImage:Bey hakim.jpg Anarchism continues to generate many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements; since the revival of anarchism in the U.S. in the 1960s,[118] a number of new movements and schools have emerged. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism as a rejuvenated form of individualist anarchism, while the burgeoning feminist and environmentalist movements also produced anarchist offshoots.\nPost-left anarchy is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;Left&quot; and to escape the confines of ideology in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements, single issue causes and calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought, and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside the leftist milieu. Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought developed by Saul Newman and associated with thinkers such as Todd May, Gilles Deleuze and F�lix Guattari. It draws from a wide range of ideas including autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, postcolonialism and Zapatismo.\nAnother recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is insurrectionary anarchism, which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include Wolfi Landstreicher and Alfredo M. Bonanno.\nImage:Murray Rothbard.jpg\n\nAnarcho-capitalism\nTemplate:Main Anarcho-capitalism (or &quot;free market anarchism&quot;)[120] is &quot;based on a belief in the freedom to own private property, a rejection of any form of governmental authority or intervention, and the upholding of the competitive free market as the main mechanism for social interaction.&quot;[121] Because of the historically anti-capitalist nature of much of anarchist thought, the status of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism is disputed particularly by communist anarchists.[122] Anarcho-capitalists distinguish between free market capitalism &#65533; peaceful voluntary exchange[123] &#65533; from &quot;state capitalism&quot; which Murray Rothbard defined as a collusive partnership between big business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market.[124] Whether in its natural rights-based, contractarian, or utilitarian formulations, anarcho-capitalism has a theory of legitimacy that supports private property as long as it was obtained by labor, trade, or gift.[125] In an anarcho-capitalist society, its proponents hold, voluntary market processes would result in the provision of social institutions such as law enforcement, defence and infrastructure by competing for-profit firms, charities or voluntary associations rather than the state.[126] In Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism, law (the non-aggression principle) is enforced by the market but not created by it, while according to David D. Friedman\'s utilitarian version, the law itself is produced by the market.\nWhile the term &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; was coined by Rothbard and its origin is attributed to 1960s United States, some historians, including Rothbard himself, trace the school as far back as the mid-19th century to market theorists such as Gustave de Molinari.[127][128] Anarcho-capitalism has drawn influence from pro-market theorists such as Molinari, Fr�d�ric Bastiat, and Robert Nozick, as well as American individualist thinkers such as Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner.[129][130] Considered a form of individualist anarchism,[131] it differs from the individualism of the &quot;Boston anarchists&quot; of the 19th century in its rejection of the labor theory of value (and its normative implications) in favor of the neoclassical or Austrian School marginalist view. Anarcho-capitalist ideas have in turn contributed to the development of agorism,[132] autarchism, and crypto-anarchism.[133]\n\nAnarcha-feminism\nTemplate:Main Image:Anfem.svg Anarcha-feminism is a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of involuntary hierarchy &#65533; to which anarchists are opposed. Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles.\nMany anarcha-feminists are especially critical of marriage. For instance, Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that &quot;&#65533;[woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life.&quot;[134] Anarcha-feminists view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the state and capitalism. Susan Brown expressed the sentiment that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist.&quot;[135] There have been several male anarcha-feminists, such as the Anarcho-communist Joseph D�jacque who opposed Proudhon\'s anti-feminist views.&quot;[136]\n\nGreen anarchism\nTemplate:Main Image:Darker green and Black flag.svg Green anarchism is an anarchist school of thought which places an emphasis on environmental issues. Sometimes, green anarchism is said to be techno-positive or techno-negative to differentiate between those who advocate use of advanced green technology to create and maintain an anarchist society and those who mainly see civilization and modern technology as something negative.\nAnarcho-primitivism is a form of green anarchism that believes agriculture and division of labour inevitably lead to inequality and are incompatible with anarchism and in effect must be abolished. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize traditional anarchism for supporting civilization and modern technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation.  They instead advocate the process of rewilding or reconnecting with the natural environment.\nNon-primitivist green anarchists, such as anthropologist Brian Morris, often draw influence from the social ecology of Murray Bookchin.\n\nAs a social movement\nAnarchism as a social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the Spanish Civil War-era struggles against fascism.[137]\nThe First International\nImage:Bakuninfull.jpg\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, wherein ten countries experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist revolutions.  After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.[139] In 1864 the International Workingmen\'s Association (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon,[140] Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats. Due to its links to active workers\' movements, the International became a significant organization. Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon\'s followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx\'s state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.[141][142]\nIn 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Mikhail Bakunin and his associates joined the First International &#65533; which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the anti-authoritarian socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarized into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.[143] Bakunin characterised Marx\'s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.[144][145] In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the anti-authoritarian sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.[146]\n\nOrganized labor\nTemplate:Main The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;[147] In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.[148] In response, unions across America prepared a general strike in support of the event.[149] Upon 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when replacement workers attempted to cross the picket line. Police intervention led to the deaths of four men, enraging the workers of the city. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago\'s Haymarket Square.[150] A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.[151] In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.[152] Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.[153] Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organizers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labor movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labor movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organize for the eight hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.[154] The celebration of International Workers\' Day on May Day became an annual event the following year.\nIn 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Beno�t Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, Christiaan Cornelissen, etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.[155] Malatesta thought that trade-unions were reformist, and could even be, at times, conservative. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example US trade-unions, where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.\nThe Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the Confederaci�n Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the Spanish Civil War. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederaci�n General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.[156] Other active syndicalist movements include the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation. The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.\n\nRussian Revolution\nTemplate:Main Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the Ukraine, anarchists fought in the civil war against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.\nExpelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin\'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&#65533; Marxist state would become a new elite[144] had proved all too true.\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organizations and joined the Communist International.\nIn Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft),[157] was supported. Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America.\nImage:Members of the Maquis in La Tresorerie.jpg\n\nFight against fascism\nTemplate:MainTemplate:See also In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism\'s conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo, which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.[158] In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.[159]\nIn Spain, the CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936&#65533;1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivized the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. According to George Orwell and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.\n\nInternal issues and debates\nTemplate:Main\nAnarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of capitalism (which anarchists usually reject, according to the Oxford Companion to Philosophy),[160] nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as Marxism, communism and capitalism. Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.\nPhenomena such as civilization, technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards race, gender and the environment have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.\nOn a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the Nihilist movement), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.\n\nFootnotes\nTemplate:Reflist\n\nSee also\nTemplate:Anarchism portal\n\nAnarchist symbolism\nList of basic anarchism topics\n\nFurther reading\nTemplate:Main\n\nAnarchism.
